When you start typing, the process spawns threads: one to read keystrokes, another to display text, one to autosave your file, and yet another to highlight spelling mistakes. By spawning multiple threads, Microsoft takes advantage of idle CPU time (waiting for keystrokes or files to load) and makes you more productive.\n",
