       "AIMessage(content='AI stands for **Artificial Intelligence**.\\n\\nAt its core, AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. It\\'s about enabling computers to perform tasks that typically require human cognition, such as:\\n\\n1.  **Learning:** Acquiring information and rules for using the information.\\n2.  **Reasoning:** Using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions.\\n3.  **Problem-solving:** Applying reasoning to solve specific problems.\\n4.  **Perception:** Understanding and interpreting the world through senses (like computer vision).\\n5.  **Language understanding:** Comprehending and generating human language (Natural Language Processing).\\n\\n**Key Concepts and Subfields of AI:**\\n\\n*   **Machine Learning (ML):** This is the most common and powerful subset of AI today. ML systems learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Instead of a human writing rules for every possible scenario, the machine identifies patterns and makes predictions or decisions based on the data it has been trained on.\\n    *   **Supervised Learning:** Learning from labeled data (e.g., showing a system thousands of cat pictures labeled \"cat\" to teach it to identify cats).\\n    *   **Unsupervised Learning:** Finding patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., grouping similar customer behaviors without prior definitions).\\n    *   **Reinforcement Learning:** Learning through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties for actions (e.g., teaching a computer to play chess by rewarding good moves).\\n\\n*   **Deep Learning (DL):** A subfield of Machine Learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence \"deep\") to learn complex patterns from large amounts of data. Deep learning is behind many breakthroughs in areas like image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.\\n\\n*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Examples include translation services, chatbots, spam filters, and sentiment analysis.\\n\\n*   **Computer Vision:** Allows computers to \"see\" and interpret visual information from images and videos. This powers facial recognition, self-driving cars, medical image analysis, and augmented reality.\\n\\n*   **Robotics:** While not exclusively AI, AI is often the \"brain\" that allows robots to perceive their environment, navigate, make decisions, and interact with the world autonomously.\\n\\n**Types of AI (Theoretical Spectrum):**\\n\\n1.  **Narrow AI (ANI) / Weak AI:** This is *all the AI that exists today*. It\\'s designed and trained for a specific task (e.g., playing chess, recommending movies, facial recognition, language translation). It can perform its specific task exceptionally well, often surpassing human ability, but it doesn\\'t possess general human-like intelligence.\\n\\n2.  **General AI (AGI) / Strong AI:** This is hypothetical AI that would possess human-level cognitive abilities across a wide range of tasks, capable of understanding, learning, and applying its intelligence to any intellectual task that a human being can. We are not yet close to achieving AGI.\\n\\n3.  **Superintelligence (ASI):** Also hypothetical, ASI would surpass human intelligence in every field, including creativity, general wisdom, and problem-solving. This is largely the realm of science fiction for now.\\n\\n**Where do you encounter AI?**\\n\\n*   **Smartphones:** Voice assistants (Siri, Google Assistant), facial recognition unlock, predictive text, photo filters.\\n*   **Streaming Services:** Personalized recommendations (Netflix, Spotify).\\n*   **E-commerce:** Product recommendations (Amazon), fraud detection.\\n*   **Healthcare:** Medical imaging analysis, drug discovery, personalized treatment plans.\\n*   **Finance:** Fraud detection, algorithmic trading, credit scoring.\\n*   **Transportation:** Self-driving cars, traffic optimization.\\n*   **Customer Service:** Chatbots, automated call routing.\\n*   **Search Engines:** Ranking results, understanding queries.\\n\\nIn essence, AI is a rapidly evolving field focused on creating intelligent machines that can learn, adapt, and perform tasks that traditionally require human intelligence, with the potential to profoundly impact nearly every aspect of our lives.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.5-flash', 'safety_ratings': []}, id='run--1a39eb17-005b-4afb-a99e-f638b84f0883-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 5, 'output_tokens': 864, 'total_tokens': 2099, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 1230}})"

    "\n",
    "- **Chatbots:** Chatbots are among the most intuitive uses of LLMs. LangChain can be used to provide proper context for the specific use of a chatbot, and to integrate chatbots into existing communication channels and workflows with their own APIs.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Summarization:** Language models can be tasked with summarizing many types of text, from breaking down complex academic articles and transcripts to providing a digest of incoming emails.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Question answering**: Using specific documents or specialized knowledge bases (like Wolfram, arXiv or PubMed), LLMs can retrieve relevant information from storage and articulate helpful answers). If fine-tuned or properly prompted, some LLMs can answer many questions even without external information.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Data augmentation:** LLMs can be used to generate synthetic data for use in machine learning. For example, an LLM can be trained to generate additional data samples that closely resemble the data points in a training dataset.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Virtual agents**: Integrated with the right workflows, LangChain’s Agent modules can use an LLM to autonomously determine next steps and take action using robotic process automation (RPA).\n"

It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access and interpret data to perform automated tasks effectively, such as identifying patterns or making decisions with minimal human intervention. Machine learning algorithms use statistical techniques to give computers a \"learning capability,\" allowing them to become more accurate in predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed for specific rules.\\n\\nThere are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning involves using labeled data (data with known answers) to train models that can make predictions or decisions based on new inputs. Unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data without predefined outcomes for the model to identify patterns and relationships within the dataset itself. Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns how to behave in an environment by performing certain actions and observing the rewards or penalties that follow, aiming to maximize its reward over time through trial-and-error experiences.\\n\\nMachine learning has numerous applications across various industries such as healthcare (predictive analytics for disease diagnosis), finance (fraud detection systems), retail (recommendation engines and customer segmentation), transportation, energy management, natural language processing, computer vision, robotic process automation, among others.

    "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is commonly used to provide LLMs with up-to-date knowledge on a particular subject or access to proprietary knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Giving LLMs Superpowers\n",
    "\n",
    "By 2020, it was becoming clear that neural AI systems could not perform tasks symbolic systems typically excelled in, such as arithmetic, accessing structured DB data, or making API calls. These tasks require discrete input parameters that allow us to process them reliably according to strict written logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2022, researchers at AI21 developed Jurassic-X, an LLM-based \"neuro-symbolic architecture.\" Neuro-symbolic refers to merging the \"neural computation\" of large language models (LLMs) with more traditional (i.e. symbolic) computation of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jurassic-X used the Modular Reasoning, Knowledge, and Language (MRKL) system [3]. The researchers developed MRKL to solve the limitations of LLMs, namely:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lack of up-to-date knowledge, whether that is the latest in AI or something as simple as today's date.\n",
    "- Lack of proprietary knowledge, such as internal company docs or your calendar bookings.\n",
    "- Lack of reasoning, i.e. the inability to perform operations that traditional software is good at, like running complex mathematical operations.\n",
    "- Lack of ability to generalize. Back in 2022, most LLMs had to be fine-tuned to perform well in a specific domain. This problem is still present today but far less prominent as the SotA models generalize much better and, in the case of MRKL, are able to use tools relatively well (although we could certainly take the MRKL solution to improve tool use performance even today).\n",
    "\n",
    "MRKL represents one of the earliest forms of what we would now call an agent; it is an LLM (neural computation) paired with executable code (symbolic computation).\n",
    "\n",
    "## ReAct and Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a misconception in the broader industry that an AI agent is an LLM contained within some looping logic that can generate inputs for and execute code functions. This definition of agents originates from the huge popularity of the ReAct agent framework and the adoption of a similar structure with function/tool calling by LLM providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Ollama.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ReAct agent flow with the Reasoning-Action loop [4]. When the action chosen specifies to use a normal tool, the tool is used and the observation returned for another iteration through the Reasoning-Action loop. To return a final answer to the user the LLM must choose action \"answer\" and provide the natural language response, finishing the loop.](/images/posts/ai-agents/ai-agents-00.png)\n",

To return a final answer to the user the LLM must choose action \"answer\" and provide the natural language response, finishing the loop.</small>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our \"neuro-symbolic\" definition is much broader but certainly does include ReAct agents and LLMs paired with tools. This agent type is the most common for now, so it's worth understanding the basic concept behind it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Re**ason **Act**ion (ReAct) method encourages LLMs to generate iterative *reasoning* and *action* steps. During *reasoning,* the LLM describes what steps are to be taken to answer the user's query. Then, the LLM generates an *action,* which we parse into an input to some executable code, which we typically describe as a tool/function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ReAct method. Each iteration includes a Reasoning step followed by an Action (tool call) step. The Observation is the output from the previous tool call. During the final iteration the agent calls the answer tool, meaning we generate the final answer for the user.](/images/posts/ai-agents/ai-agents-01.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "<small>ReAct method. Each iteration includes a Reasoning step followed by an Action (tool call) step. The Observation is the output from the previous tool call. During the final iteration the agent calls the answer tool, meaning we generate the final answer for the user.</small>\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the reason and action steps, our action tool call returns an observation. The logic returns the observation to the LLM, which is then used to generate subsequent reasoning and action steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ReAct loop continues until the LLM has enough information to answer the original input. Once the LLM reaches this state, it calls a special *answer* action with the generated answer for the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Not only LLMs and Tool Calls\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs paired with tool calling are powerful but far from the only approach to building agents. Using the definition of neuro-symbolic, we cover architectures such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multi-agent workflows that involve multiple LLM-tool (or other agent structure) combinations.\n",
    "- More deterministic workflows where we may have set neural model-tool paths that may fork or merge as the use case requires.\n",
    "- Embedding models that can detect user intents and decide tool-use or LLM selection-based selection in vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few high-level examples of alternative agent structures. Far from being designed for niche use cases, we find these alternative options to frequently perform better than the more common ReAct or Tool agents. We will cover all of these examples and more in future chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents are fundamental to the future of AI, but that doesn't mean we should expect that future to come from agents in their most popular form today. ReAct and Tool agents are great and handle many simple use cases well, but the scope of agents is much broader, and we believe thinking beyond ReAct and Tools is key to building future AI.\n",
